# Project Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the project locally on your machine. Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed before you begin.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

- Git: You'll need Git to clone the project repository. You can download it from [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Run the following command to clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SoumyadiptoPal/GDSC_Dev_Assignment.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager). Run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Development Server**: Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This command will start the development server and automatically open the project in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the code will trigger hot-reloading, so you can see the results in real-time.

6. **Access the Project**: Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the running project.
